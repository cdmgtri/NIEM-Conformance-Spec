1. Purpose

   This is a high-level document that introduces NIEM conformance and provides a general normative definition for its meaning, how it applies, to what it applies, as well as to what it does not apply. This document describes the benefits of conformance, and refers to sources of information, tools, and help. See these references to learn more about NIEM conformance and how to apply NIEM conformance in practice.

   Use this document to understand the general nature of NIEM conformance and to identify the key specifications that define the details of NIEM conformance for users and developers.

2. Definition of NIEM conformance

   Conformance to NIEM is defined in terms of artifacts, NOT implementations, databases, systems, or tools. NIEM defines various [conformance targets] as the classes of artifacts to which sets of normative rules apply. This document will only address these concepts at a basic level. Refer to [NIEM NDR 4.0], [NIEM Conformance Targets Attribute Specification 3.0], and [NIEM MPD Specification 3.0.1] for more details on conformance targets.

   [Definition: conformance target]

      A class of artifact, such as an interface, protocol, document, platform, process or service that is the subject of conformance clauses and normative statements. There may be several conformance targets defined within a specification, and these targets may be diverse so as to reflect different aspects of a specification. For example, a protocol message and a protocol engine may be different conformance targets.

   In general, the three most basic NIEM conformance targets are: 

      *  Conformant instance XML document - An XML document that is an instance of a conformant schema document set and MUST conform to all applicable rules in the NIEM Naming and Design Rules [NIEM NDR 4.0].

      *  Conformant schema document set - A collection of XML Schema documents that together are capable of validating a conformant instance XML document. A conformant schema document set MUST conform to all applicable rules in the NIEM Naming and Design Rules [NIEM NDR 4.0].

      *  Conformant Model Package Description (MPD) - A ZIP file that contains a schema document set that conforms to the rules specified in the NIEM Model Package Description Specification [NIEM MPD Specification 3.0.1] that apply to its MPD class. [NIEM MPD Specification 3.0.1] specifies two MPD classes: (1) an MPD (the general class), and (2) Information Exchange Package Documentation (IEPD). An IEPD is also an MPD. In the future, other MPD classes will be formalized and specified. These will include: NIEM release, domain update, Core update, and Enterprise Information Exchange Model (EIEM).

   NIEM does not define information exchange implementation conformance. In general, an implementation that deploys NIEM-conformant instance XML documents on a transmission medium is considered a NIEM information exchange. However, an implementation may apply encryption, compression, Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) encoding [W3-EXI], or other security and/or efficiency techniques to an NIEM instance XML document as required; and it will still represent a NIEM information exchange. Furthermore, NIEM is considered a payload layer, and as such, a NIEM-conformant instance XML document may be contained within a standard envelope (such as SOAP, LEXS, etc.) or other XML-based standards. In describing an implementation that employs NIEM, an author should be as descriptive as is necessary to convey clear understanding of how NIEM is used.

   Reference schema document sets (i.e., NIEM releases, domain updates, and core updates) are subject to rigorous quality and conformance testing to ensure they are NIEM-conformant. However, IEPDs are not under the NIEM PMO control and are not subject to a formal certification process. Therefore, it is important for NIEM users and developers to understand and make a concerted effort to ensure IEPDs they produce conform to the [NIEM MPD Specification 3.0.1].

   In general, NIEM specifies that an IEPD conforms to NIEM under the following conditions:

      1. Each XML schema document within the IEPD adheres to all rules in the [NIEM NDR 4.0] for this schema's [conformance target] class (e.g., reference schema document, extension schema document, external schema document, etc.).

      2. Each sample instance XML document within the IEPD validates to a NIEM-conformant schema document set in the IEPD, and adheres to all rules in the NIEM NDR for instance XML documents.

      3. The IEPD itself adheres to the NIEM MPD Specification (including required files, packaging, metadata, etc.).

      4. If an existing NIEM component matches the business semantics required by the IEPD, then that component is used by the IEPD, either directly or as the basis for derived components. That is, the IEPD does not unnecessarily duplicate NIEM components.

      5. Each NIEM schema component used by the IEPD, either directly or as the basis for derived components, is used in a manner consistent with the component's structural definition and business semantics. That is, the IEPD preserves semantic and structural consistency.

   There are subjective factors in applying these rules that require diligent consideration by the organization that develops an IEPD. It is important that decisions about semantics be made (or reviewed) by business subject-matter-experts (SMEs) who have thorough knowledge of the information exchange requirements, its business processes, and the domain for which it is being built.

   For more detailed rules regarding IEPD conformance refer to [NIEM NDR 4.0] and [NIEM MPD Specification 3.0.1].

3. NIEM does not define compliance

   NIEM does NOT define compliance. This term implies enforcement and the existence of an official certification process that verifies conformance or level of conformance. Though it is envisioned for NIEM in the future, a formal certification process does not yet exist. Therefore, compliance to NIEM is currently undefined and has no meaning.

   Early in the development of NIEM, governance committees discussed the language to be used in solicitations (such as grants, requests for proposals, etc.) that require use of NIEM. They considered both terms, and concluded that the term compliance does not convey appropriate intent; it is too regulatory (for example, U.S. citizens and residents must comply with the U.S. tax code). The objectives of NIEM are to develop information exchange standards that users desire, but are not forced, to use. Furthermore, the purpose of both programs is to facilitate and support interoperability, NOT to force or regulate it.

   Thus, the appropriate assertion is: Contract or grant awardees comply with contract or grant language, and that language requires IEPDs (and other MPDs), and their associated XML schema document sets and instance XML documents to conform to NIEM. (See [NIEM Implementation Guidance] which also outlines the general conformance rules.)

4. NIEM-aware or -supporting vs. NIEM-conformant

   Systems, tools, and databases DO NOT and CANNOT conform to NIEM. Only XML schema documents and document sets, instance XML documents, and MPDs can conform to NIEM. For any other entity or artifact, NIEM conformance is undefined. Internal names, or usage of data, within a given system, tool, or database have absolutely no impact on the determination of NIEM conformance. Conformance is only about:

      *  XML schema document sets that conform to the [NIEM NDR 4.0].

      *  Payload data encapsulated in instance XML documents that conform to the [NIEM NDR 4.0] and validate to a given NIEM schema document set.

      *  The metadata, documentation, [conformance targets], structure, and packaging of schema document sets in NIEM MPDs as defined in the [NIEM MPD Specification 3.0.1], which addresses MPDs in general and more specifically IEPDs (In the future, other NIEM specifications will define the rules for releases, domain updates, core updates, and EIEMs.).

   An XML schema document that copies, maps to, or uses the data component names of NIEM XML document schemas or the data components they contain without importing corresponding NIEM target namespaces does not conform to NIEM. Conforming to NIEM requires that an XML schema document reuse NIEM by importing through xs:import the target namespaces of NIEM reference schema documents or schema subset documents of NIEM reference schema documents.

   A tool, system, or database may have capabilities designed to specifically support the development of NIEM-conformant IEPDs, or that may be part of a development environment that specifically supports the implementation of NIEM-conformant IEPDs, or that may be used to test or verify NIEM-conformance, etc. Also, a system may provide the capability to generate, send and receive, and/or process NIEM-conformant information exchanges. Such tools or systems are NOT considered NIEM-conformant, however, because they support conformance, they may be considered NIEM-aware or NIEM-supporting.

   NIEM allows various extension methods to design and build additional XML data components that are not otherwise defined in NIEM. Tools that assist in the creation of such extensions may also be referred to as NIEM-aware or -supporting. However, implementers should be careful to avoid violating general conformance rules regarding duplication and consistency outlined in Section 2, Definition of NIEM conformance, above.

5. Information sources for NIEM conformance

   NIEM conformance means adherence to the following specifications:

      *  NIEM Naming and Design Rules (NDR) 3.0 - The current normative reference for XML schema document set and instance XML document conformance to NIEM [NIEM NDR 4.0].

      *  NIEM Conformance Target Attribute Specification (CTAS) 3.0 - The current normative reference that specifies an XML attribute that may occur within XML documents to establish a claim that the document conforms to a set of conformance targets [NIEM Conformance Targets Attribute Specification 3.0].

      *  NIEM Model Package Description Specification 3.0 - The current normative reference for NIEM IEPDs and other MPD classes of schema document sets [NIEM MPD Specification 3.0.1].

      *  W3C XML Schema - The normative reference for the XML Schema Definition Language [W3C XML Schema] used by NIEM.

   Other useful non-normative documents and Web pages:

      *  NIEM User Guide volume 1 - A guide to the use of NIEM for designing and developing IEPDs (older reference but still contains good information about the IEPDs and the process for building them).[NIEM-UG].

      *  NIEM Implementation Guide - A Web page that describes NIEM conformance language for solicitations, contracts, and grants [NIEM Implementation Guidance].

6. Benefits of IEPDs that conform to NIEM

   There are several advantages to developing NIEM-conformant IEPDs, including:

      *  Semantic and structural consistency.

      *  A higher degree of data interoperability.

      *  Can be reused as-is or adapted in whole or part.

      *  Easy to work with because reference schema documents (and subset schemas derived from them) use a profile of [W3C XML Schema], thus the number of acceptable XML Schema Definition (XSD) mechanisms in use is constrained.

      *  NIEM IEPDs can be built, modified, and reused with NIEM-aware reference tools [NIEM-Tools], and with other existing and future tools [NIEM-Tools-Catalog] that follow the NIEM High-Level Tool Architecture [NIEM-HLTA].

      *  Can be registered, stored, published, and shared in a repository.

      *  IEPDs can be extended when NIEM does not satisfy a data requirement.

      *  IEPDs can employ other XML standards natively through the NIEM adapter mechanism (See [NIEM NDR 4.0]).

      *  Can use the OMG NIEM-UML profile [NIEM-UML] with a UML modeling tool.

      *  Migration support exists if or when a NIEM IEPD must be updated to a later release version of NIEM [NIEM-Tools].

      *  IEPD extension schemas can be mined and reviewed by governance bodies for potential additions to future NIEM releases (Core and domains). This is a simple way to identify and suggest new or modified common requirements for NIEM. (See [NIEM-HLVA])

      *  NIEM PMO continues to encourage open and commercial tool support for NIEM IEPDs.

7. Suggestions to IEPD developers

   Obviously, being as knowledgeable as possible with XML, NIEM, and its documentation is important. To help increase understanding of and skill in building NIEM-conformant IEPDs, developers are also encouraged to:

      *  Use NIEM-aware on-line reference tools [NIEM-Tools] provided by the NIEM PMO.

      *  Use NIEM-aware tools identified in the [NIEM-Tools-Catalog] and that follow the NIEM High-Level Tool Architecture [NIEM-HLTA].

      *  Use (or reuse) methods and patterns from other NIEM-conformant schemas (e.g., use existing NIEM-conformant schema documents as templates).

      *  Adhere to the current [NIEM NDR 4.0] and [NIEM MPD Specification 3.0.1] Specification.

      *  Attend formal NIEM training; or complete NIEM on-line training [NIEM-Training]).

      *  Follow guidelines presented in formal NIEM training, in on-line training, and in the NIEM User Guide Volume 1 [NIEM-UG].
